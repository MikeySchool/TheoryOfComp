# Project 2: Nondeterministic Finite Automata

* Author: Mikey Krentz, Brandon Burr

## Overview

This program constructs an NFA from a given text file. The NFA can be converted to a DFA if the user so wishes it.

## Compiling and Using

javac fa/nfa/NFADriver.javac
java fa.nfa.NFADriver <test_file>

## Discussion

Overall the concept of this project was very straightforward. There were a few
significant opportunities for good recursive implementations, and there wasn't
much required outside of the primary goal of the project.

## Testing

To test, we used the default files, and tried to also implement a few cyclic NFA's
to see if we could trip our code up. Ultimately, we ended up tripping up when writing
an NFA where the initial state was also an accept state. This was difficult, and we don't
know how we could have done it correclty, in hindsight. Our NFA accepted this, but we couldn't
seem to make a proper DFA to accept this same requirement.
